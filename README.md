BEES Data Engineering – Breweries Case
Objective:
The goal of this test is to assess your skills in consuming data from an API, transforming and
persisting it into a data lake following the medallion architecture with three layers: raw data,
curated data partitioned by location, and an analytical aggregated layer.
Instructions:
1. API: Use the Open Brewery DB API to fetch data. The API has an endpoint for
listing breweries: <https://www.openbrewerydb.org/>
2. Orchestration Tool: Choose the orchestration tool of your preference (Airflow,
Luigi, Mage etc.) to build a data pipeline. We're interested in seeing your ability to
handle scheduling, retries, and error handling in the pipeline.
3. Language: Use the language of your preference for the requests and data
transformation. Please include test cases for your code. Python and PySpark are
preferred but not mandatory.
4. Containerization: If you use Docker or Kubernetes for modularization, you'll earn
extra points.
5. Data Lake Architecture: Your data lake must follow the medallion architecture
having a bronze, silver, and gold layer:
a. Bronze Layer: Persist the raw data from the API in its native format or
any format you find suitable.
b. Silver Layer: Transform the data to a columnar storage format such as
parquet or delta, and partition it by brewery location. Please explain any
other transformations you perform.
c. Gold Layer: Create an aggregated view with the quantity of breweries per
type and location.
6. Monitoring/Alerting: Describe how you would implement a monitoring and
alerting process for this pipeline. Consider data quality issues, pipeline failures,
and other potential problems in your response.
7. Repository: Create a public repository on GitHub with your solution. Document
your design choices, trade-offs, and provide clear instructions on how to run your
application.
8. Cloud Services: If your solution requires any cloud services, please provide
instructions on how to set them up. Please do not post them in your public
repository.

Evaluation Criteria:
Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
1. Code Quality
2. Solution Design
3. Efficiency
4. Completeness
5. Documentation
6. Error Handling
   
Time Frame:
Please complete the test within 1 week and share the link to your GitHub repository with us.
Remember, the goal of this test is to showcase your skills and approach to building a data
pipeline. Good luck!
